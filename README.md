# My second attempt at CS229

My first attempt at CS229 in the Summer of 2023 left me crying my way through the quarter. A year and a half later, I am determined to get better at this. Researching LLMs has made it clear that I need a stronger grasp of the math behind the papers I read.

Back in 2023, I had the incredible opportunity to take CS229 with Dr. Anand Avati, but I really was too unprepared to keep up. I lacked the mathematical maturity (especially in Linear Algebra + Probability and Statistics which I realized were *CRUCIAL* for this course), and also the mental preparation of how hard the course was going to be especially since it was shrunk from a 10-week version down to a mere 8-weeks. On top of that, I was still figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. Without a clear purpose, I didnâ€™t push myself hard enough, and I paid the price.

I think I must have PTSD from the course because I as hard as I try to recall, I remember little about the content and I always felt it was a shame. Now, with a much stronger motivation to understand my research, I have decided to retake this course on my own and really commit to mastering the material, even if it means I struggle again (which I likely will). Wish me luck.

My first attempt at CS229 in the Summer of 2023 left me crying my way through the quarter. A year and a half later, I am determined to get better at this. Motivation is that now I am doing research in LLM. But I struggle to understand the Math behind the papers. I had the wonderful opportunity in Summer of 2023 to take CS229 taught by Dr Anand Avati. However, I really was too smooth brained back then to understand much + was trying to figure out what to do with my life didn't help with having the motivation to push beyond. And so I struggled. Really hard. I think i must have PTSD from the course because I as hard as I try to recall, I remember little from the course and I always felt it was a shame. With the need to understand my research, I have decided to retake this course on my own nd really commit to learning and improving my knowledge, even if it means I struggle again (which I likely will).   -->
